    Short Description: My childhood swag and obsession with clothes.

    Actual Page Text: 

        As a child growing up, I loved dressing up for the occasion – mainly for my religious holiday. Being that I 
        didn’t know much about fashion, my mom would ask me what color I’d prefer, and she’d go ahead and 
        find what she believe is the best in that color. Oh, and I found my shades obsession that lived on 
        forever.
        
        I was always a very shy and introverted child, so my clothes were my primary way to express myself. I’d 
        dress for Eid (an Islamic holiday), my birthday, Halloween and more.
