        In COVID, staying home and having a remote job allowed me to make my own money. As I grew into 
        maturity, I began to buy my own clothes and enhance my own fashion as I realized I shouldn't continue 
        to ask my parents for my clothes and shoes. My sneaker collection kicked off and I started to look into affordable designer clothing.

    Short Description: Showing how COVID revived and grew my passion for dressing up and buying sneakers

    Actual Page Text:

        to ask my parents for my clothes and shoes. My sneaker collection kicked off so fast

        Then in 3 months, my Jordan collection grew into this:
