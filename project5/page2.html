        maturity, I began to buy my own clothes and enhance my own fashion as I realized I shouldn’t continue 
        to ask my parents for my clothes and shoes. My sneaker collection kicked off so fast

        This was my first pair of Jordans, and they meant so much to me. Jordan 11 ‘Jubilee’:

        Then in 3 months, my Jordan collection grew into this:

        My hoodie collection grew from Nike hoodies into supporting black businesses, etc. This is what it looks like now:
