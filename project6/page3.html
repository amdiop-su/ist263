        Arriving at Syracuse University in the fall, I was very antisocial and I had a very slow start socially. I was a general body member of African Student Union and luckily, I was convinced enought to step out of my comfort zone. I auditioned and was accepted to participate in a annual fashion show for ASU and it turned out great. The entire experience was worthwhiile from meeting new people to rehearsing with them to mastering different flows of model. It all came out great and here is my two favorite images of me from this successful event: <br>

    Title: My Fashion Status Now

    Short Description: How it is in college

    Actual Page Text:
        These are my shoes desires:
        These are the clothes I really want very soon:
        On campus, I want more professional clothing and shoes and I will do more research and seek out help 
        to work on my public image. I want to express a very clean and neat image so that it is much easier to 
        work on my public speaking skills
