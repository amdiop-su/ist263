    Title: My Fashion Status Now

    Short Description: How it is in college

    Actual Page Text:
        These are my shoes desires:
        These are the clothes I really want very soon:
        On campus, I want more professional clothing and shoes and I will do more research and seek out help 
        to work on my public image. I want to express a very clean and neat image so that it is much easier to 
        work on my public speaking skills
